Version: Version 2

## Estimation approach

Consider the EZElectronics project in the CURRENT version (as provided by the teachers). Assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENTLY of the course deadlines and from scratch.

## Estimate by size

|                         | Estimate                        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |  
| NC = Estimated number of classes to be developed   | 32                             |
| A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC       | 100                            |
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A) | 3200                           |
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)  | 320                              |
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro) | 9600                     |
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) | 8 weeks            |

## Estimate by product decomposition

| Component name       | Estimated effort (person hours) |
| ---------------------| ------------------------------- |
| Requirement document | 45                              |
| GUI prototype        | 20                              |
| Design document      | 35                              |
| Code                 | 180                             |
| Unit tests           | 15                              |
| API tests            | 15                              |
| Management documents | 10                              |

## Estimate by activity decomposition

| Activity name          | Estimated effort (person hours) |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Project Kickoff        | 40                              |
| Requirement Document   | 32                              |
| Design UI/UX           | 40                              |
| Develop Backend        | 120                             |
| Develop Frontend       | 80                              |
| Integration & Testing  | 24                              |

### Summary

Report here the results of the three estimation approaches. The estimates may differ. Discuss here the possible reasons for the difference.

|                           | Estimated effort (by person-hours) | Estimated duration |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Estimate by size          | 320                                | 8 weeks            |
| Estimate by product decomposition | 325                         | N/A                |
| Estimate by activity decomposition | 336 (approximately)        | N/A                |

**Estimate by Size:**
This approach estimates effort and duration based on the size of the project, considering the number of classes and their average size. In this case, it estimates 3200 lines of code (LOC) with an effort of 320 person hours over 8 weeks. Differences in this approach may arise from variations in class complexity or individual coding speed.

**Estimate by Product Decomposition:**
This approach breaks down the project into its components (e.g., requirement document, GUI prototype, etc.) and estimates effort for each component individually. Although effort estimates are provided for each component, the overall duration is not directly provided. Variations in this approach could stem from differences in the estimation of effort for each component.

**Estimate by Activity Decomposition:**
Here, effort is estimated based on project activities (e.g., develop backend, requirement document, etc.) rather than specific project components or size. The estimated effort is around 336 hours, but the duration in calendar weeks is not directly provided. Differences in this approach may result from variations in the time required for each activity or differences in the understanding of what constitutes each activity.
