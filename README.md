# EZElectronics

EZElectronics (read EaSy Electronics) is a software application designed to help managers of electronics stores to manage their products and offer them to customers through a dedicated website. Managers can assess the available products, record new ones, and confirm purchases. Customers can see available products, add them to a cart to buy them, see the history of their past purchases, leave reviews of the products they have purchased, and see the reviews of the available products. Admins can assess the status of the system and manage data through delete operations.

# Second Assignment

The goal of the second assignment is as follows:

1. Implement the server of the application, following the requirements defined in ![OfficialRequirementsDocumentV2.md](./OfficialRequirementsDocumentV2.md) and the specifications defined in ![API.md](./API.md). A correct implementation of the server will ensure that the client works as intended with all of its features.
2. Test the implementation of the server. More details on how to perform tests will be provided in the upcoming weeks. The repository contains examples of how to perform unit tests, examples on other testing methodologies will be explained later.
