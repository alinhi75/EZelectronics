# Informal description

EZElectronics (read EaSy Electronics) is a software application designed to help managers of electronics stores to manage their products and offer them to customers through a dedicated website. Managers can assess the available products, record new ones, and confirm purchases. Customers can see available products, add them to a cart and see the history of their past purchases.

# Defect table

The API specification and code implementation differ in some points from what is actually stated in this document.
The table below describes the defects found and how these defects will be fixed in V2.
